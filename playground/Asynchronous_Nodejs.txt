Asynchronous Node.js (Weather App)

---Asynchronous programming Model----


---call stack and event loop ---
call stack -
call stack is part of v8 for our syncronous example

call stack simple data structure that keeps track of program execution inside of the v8

It keeps track of the functions currently executing and the statement that are fired.

call stack really simple data structure that can do thing
1 u can add something on the top of it 
2nd u can remove the top item (example tenis ball)

1st ball then 2nd, 2nd remove then 1st     |	2	|
											--------
										   |	1	|
										    --------	  
var x = 1;
var y = x + 9;
console.log(`y is $(y)`);


node run main() by v8
var x = 1;
once it done we can remove it and move to next
and make variable y var y = x + 9;
then console.log prints y 
and removed
at this point all program statement execution complete and main() is running

---pretty printing object---
console.log(JSON.stringify(body, undefined, 2));



2 types of error 
1 : machine error like unable to connect network shown in error object
2 : error form other like google server
